Turning the card game War into a GUI with interactive buttons and a scoreboard

every one needs a little game to distract them every now and then so i came up with the idea to make the card game War into a fun little desktop gui that one can play during some down time. it’s a very simple game in which who ever has the highest ranked card takes the other players card. however, when both players show the same ranked card they then set aside three cards from the top of their decks and reveal the next card and who ever wins that takes all the cards. the way i plan on doing this project is first starting with a source code from github which there are multiple of, inset link here, and taking bits and pieces from each to make my own. then i will incorporate a gui that will have buttons for each turn and a scoreboard that shows who’s in the lead. each game will be played until a full 52 card deck is played and who ever has the most cards at the end is the winner of the game. i believe this is a one person project and plan on working on and completing it by myself.
